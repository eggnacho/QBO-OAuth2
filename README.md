I am still learning Python and general coding. If you are making an API with QBO, this should allow you to edit just the ClientID and Client Secret to Authenticate.

Code should obtain: Realm ID, Authorization Code, Access Token, and Refresh Token.

Code uses Flask and requires you to add "http://localhost:5000/callback" to your Redirect URIs in the Intuit Developer Dashboard
